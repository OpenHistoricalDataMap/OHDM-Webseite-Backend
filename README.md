# Website for the OpenHistoricalDataMap project 
This repository contains all the content of the [OHDM-Website](http://141.45.146.200:8888/ohdm/), such as backend and frontend. To get a rough overview on the features of the project, take a look at the different repositories of this project. 

The main goal for our working group in this semester was to include as many features as possible into the website and to create a ground base for upcoming semesters, which they can use to refine and further develop this website. 

## Existing features
As for now this website can display a time sensitive map rendered by [Geoserver](https://github.com/robertd99/GeoserverOHDM/wiki).<br>
It is also able to calculate and show [routes in the last few centuries](https://github.com/OpenHistoricalDataMap/OHDM_Traveler/wiki) for different parameters e.g. farmer - walking or royal person - horse drawn carriage. 
For further details have a look at [here](https://github.com/OpenHistoricalDataMap/OHDM_Traveler/wiki). <br>
Users are also able to choose an area on the map, which they can export with this simple version of the Export Tool.
